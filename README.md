# Python for Scientists
This is a collection of notebooks for a python short course for scientists. These notebooks are designed to be useful both in class and to students outside of class. Any suggestions for making them better is helpful.

The learning goals for these notebooks are:

1. Students should feel comfortable with standard data types in python (list, string, float, int, dict, etc)
2. Students should be able to import data and export data using pandas
3. Students should be able to make maps in python that include data such as points and heat maps
4. Students should be able to make plots in python that have horizontal and vertical axes of different datas
5. Students should be able to manipulate histograms in python and create visualizations of histograms
6. Students should be comfortable with jupyter notebooks
7. Students should be able to perform "exploratory data analysis" and generate a hypothesis from it

Some notebooks may come originally from https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook but have been altered for this course.
